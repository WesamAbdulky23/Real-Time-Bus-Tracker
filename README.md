# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project shows the bus stops between Harvard and MIT, using mapbox to generate a map and adding a marker that shows each stop.
to start the application, download all files and open folder with vscode and run it on a web browser. or run the HTML file.
future improvements would be adding a visible line representing the track, adding an option to input desired coordinations.
